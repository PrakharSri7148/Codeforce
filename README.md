Solutions to Codeforces problems organized by contests and difficulty levels

## Repository Structure
The solutions are organized to be easily searchable. I'll primarily use the following structure:

### 1. By Contest ID
Problems solved during a specific Codeforces contest will be grouped into folders named after the Contest ID and/or Title.

### 2. By Difficulty (Rating)
Standalone problems or problems solved outside of a direct contest will be grouped by their difficulty rating.

### 3. By Topic Tag (Optional)
For deep practice, some folders might be created for specific topics.

## Languages Used
The solutions are written in **java** due to its widespread use and efficiency in competitive programming.
